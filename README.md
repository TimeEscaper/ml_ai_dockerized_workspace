# Machine Learning and Computer Vision dockerized workspace

Docker image and simple related container managment script that are designed for research and development purposes in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Initially, the idea of "dockerized workspace" was inspired by the dependencies and configurations mess that I faced while installing OpenCV, ROS and Anaconda together on my host system. This is not the best way to use Docker, but it can be something like "personal workaround" for that mess.
